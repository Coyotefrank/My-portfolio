                <p>Greetings all! My name is Francisco Jimenez. I am a proud husband to an amazing women and a proud father of two fun life loving boys. I have a background in many traits such as tile and stone, landscaping and other construction work. From a young age, I was always taught that a mans job is to provide and always work hard. Having been raised by my great grandparents I definetly had a different childhood then most of my friends. While most of my friends were out doing things for fun during summer break I was at work. During that time I was upset and thought that life was not fair. In the near future I learend very quickly that was all to my benefit. Now I have an amazing family and great life, through ups and downs I've always been able to look back on my childhood and as rough as it was I am eternaly greatful for my great grandparents teaching me the only way they knew how. As far as I can tell this far it was the right way.</p>
                <p>Fun facts about me! I am a hobbiest in my free time I enjoy the art of blacksmithing. I use fire and hammer to make all kinds of tools and other useful things, such as knives axes and coat hangers out of rail road spikes. I am also an avid fisherman and general outdoors men.</p>
